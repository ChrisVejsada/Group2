# Group 2 Project ![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")
Our goal its to make a metric program that able to show the user the metrics of a website or a file. It will
tell the use the amount of lines code and text. It will tell the user what kind of operators are present when the program is a java, c or a c++ file.
The user will then be given in a app window the metrics of their data based on the file that they 
provided. This application will work with both Mac and Windows machines.
> The program will allow the user to link a website(like a github file) or input a local file into the program
and then it will give the user the options to select what kind of metric they would like to see. The options we have to far are
word count, line count, character count, comment line count and source line count.
